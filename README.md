# Sign-Language-Detection
Simple Sign Detector
Overview:
Developed a deep learning model for sign language detection using TensorFlow and Keras.
Trained on a dataset containing images of alphabet signs (A-Z), number signs (0-9), and an additional class for '_' (underscore).
Achieved accurate classification of sign language gestures, making it suitable for educational and assistive technology applications.
Features:
Multi-class Classification:


Recognizes a diverse set of sign language gestures, including alphabets and numbers.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):


Utilizes a CNN architecture for image classification, capturing spatial hierarchies in sign language images.

# How to run on your system
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:


Python (>= 3.6)
pip (Python package installer)
Streamlit
Tkinter


Installation:
1. Clone the repository or download the .zip file
2. Extract all the file
3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. For GUI: write `python sign_gui.py` in your terminal
5. For WebApp: write `streamlit run webApp.py` in your terminal
 Note: Make sure you are in the same directory in your terminal as of the files to run scripts from terminal
